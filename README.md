# Regression-On-House-Prices
Introduction
House prices increase every year, so there is a need for a system to predict house prices in thefuture. House price prediction can help the developer determine the selling price of a house andcan help the customer to arrange the right time to purchase a house. There are two factors thatinfluence the price of a house which include physical conditions and location. The physicalconditions are nothing but how many rooms, availability of kitchen, bedrooms etc,and thelocation factor involves ease of access to public facilities, such as schools, campus, hospitalsand health centers, as well as family recreation facilities such as malls, culinary tours, or evenoffer a beautiful scenery .We will take the Housing dataset which contains information aboutdifferent houses in Boston.This project aims to find the factors affecting the domestic propertyvalue in the city of Boston so that we can fit our machine learning model.There are 506 samplesand 13 feature variables in this dataset. We will be using regression technique to predict the house prices from the given features.

Regression Analysis

In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating therelationships among variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing severalvariables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or
more independent variables (or 'predictors'). More specifically, regression analysis helps oneunderstand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changeswhen any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.

Objective

 Find the factors that are affecting the house prices
 Fit a model considering these factors.
 Evaluating the performances of different regression techniques and propose the best regression model

Data Description

The description of all the features is given below:

NOX: Nitric oxide concentration (parts per 10 million)
RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling
AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways
TAX: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000
PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
